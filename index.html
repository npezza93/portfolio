<h2 class='invisible'>Archipelago</h2>
<hr class='invisible'>
<div class='text invisible'><p>Archipelago is an open-source terminal emulator built on <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and utilizes <a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js">Xterm.js</a>. Archipelago also has an accompanying Atom package so you can open a terminal inside your development environment.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of web technologies, so I started using
<a href="https://github.com/zeit/hyper">Hyper</a> as my default terminal while it was in beta.
Hyper was by far the coolest, best looking, and extensible terminal emulator I had used and being an Electron app, it was cross-platform.</p>

<p>But, I found Hyper(beta and version 1) to be extremely slow, to the point that if I was going to run a command that I knew would have a lot of output, I would opt for using the OS default. Along with that, occasionally buffers would overlap making the terminal unreadable and force me to restart the terminal.</p>

<p>After using Hyper for a while and then finding the <a href="https://xtermjs.org/">Xterm.js</a> project(Hyper was using <a href="https://github.com/chromium/hterm">Hterm</a> at this point, it has since switched to Xterm.js as of v2), I thought perhaps I can make a terminal that performs faster than Hyper. So that's what Archipelago is, my perfect terminal, fast, pretty, extensible, and stable.</p>

<h2 class='invisible'>California University of PA Class Advisor</h2>
<hr class='invisible'>
<div class='text invisible'><p>At CalU there are two systems in place that help students build their schedule for the upcoming semester. The first of the systems is the Vulcan Information Portal(VIP); here students submit the classes they want to enroll in, the student's prerequisites are validated, and all the courses that are available for the upcoming semester are viewable. The second system is DegreeWorks which tells the student all the classes that are needed to fulfill their major and minor(s).</p>

<p>These two systems should be communicating, but are not. Instead, every student has to set up a meeting with their faculty advisor before every semester to go over what courses to enroll in for the next semester. In these, students and advisors have to go back and forth between these systems to develop a schedule which is time-consuming and a hassle for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The Calu Advisor combines these two systems. Before every semester a faculty advisor uploads all the courses offered for the upcoming semester(CSV file) and the student inputs their current transcript from DegreeWorks. The CalU Advisor then gives the student only classes that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are offered;</li>
  <li>fulfill a requirement in their major or minor(s); and</li>
  <li>meets all prerequisites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students can also filter courses based on times they cannot attend class. After building their schedule, they automatically submit it to their advisor and, without setting up a meeting, their advisor can approve it.</p>

<p>The Calu Advisor is a responsive web application built on Rails 5.1.1, and <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web">Material Design Components</a>, with a PostgreSQL database.</p>
